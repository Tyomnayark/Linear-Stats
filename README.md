# LINEAR STATS Project for z01 school

Linear-Stats is a program that calculates statistical values such as the Linear Regression Line and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient based on input data from a file.

## Description

The Linear-Stats program reads data from a file specified as a command-line argument. The input file represents a graph with the x-axis values as the number of lines (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...) and the y-axis values as the actual numbers. The program then calculates the Linear Regression Line and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for the provided data and prints the results in the specified format.

## Usage

To use the MATH-SKILLS project, follow these steps:

* Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
* Import the project into your preferred Java development environment (vs code).
* Use the terminal: 
````
javac LinearStats.java
